Project made for Mount Royal University's COMP 3512: Web II: Web Application and Development taught by Randy Connolly
Created by: Jonathan Cates and Priyash Bista

The project is a series of 3 assignments that built on each other throughout the semester. Each assignment spec is in the repository. The overall project was to create a website to buy famous pieces of art. Included as features were a favourites list, shopping cart, and the ability to read all data from a local databse saved as a JSON object.

The final grade was an A.
